# Code of Conduct

Everyone who participates in any DAPPER Stats project is expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

Juniper Simonis, as owner and lead scientist of DAPPER Stats, and all lab members are dedicated to actively creating a ***harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone***. Discrimination or harassment based on classifications such as (but not limited to) race, ethnicity, citizenship, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status, age, appearance or body size will not be tolerated.  **We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by or of members of our community in any form**. 

We ask all members of the DAPPER Stats community to abide by the following Code of Conduct:

* All communication - online and in person, verbal and non-verbal - should be appropriate for an audience with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributers.

* Harassment and sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* In general, assume that others are acting in good faith; for example, when they make suggestions or give criticism.

* Prioritize an inclusive environment. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

* Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology and make space for healing. Commit to learning and doing better.

Individuals asked to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately.

**To report an issue** please contact [Juniper Simonis](mailto:simonis@dapperstats.com). All communication will be treated as confidential.
