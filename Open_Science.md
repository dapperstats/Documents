# Open Science

Insofar as it is possible, DAPPER Stats is an [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) organization. We believe that science is best when done as a public endeavor and done in the public good. Science allows us to be part of something bigger than ourselves. To foster a healthy, collaborative and truly inclusive scientific enterprise, it is essential that we give back at least as much as we take from the community. 

What we commit to do, as open scientists, is:

* Make supporting research data freely available whenever possible, to support future use in meta-analyses, reviews, and revisitations of our work. 

* Respect privacy and confidentiality in cases where data or research products contain sensitive information. Acknowledge the primacy of client/collaborator restrictions with respect to sharing of our scientific output. Do no harm.

* Produce and share reproducible, re-usable data manipulation and analysis code, so people can understand our assumptions and workflows, and so future scientists can learn from our efforts without duplicating them.

* Publish final manuscripts AND intermediate research products in the most accessible formats available to us. 

* Seek out expertise from conventional and unconventional stakeholders in our work. Invite comment and participation. Welcome feedback.

* Acknowledge all contributions to our work and cite the ideas of others, be they in formal or informal sources. We do not work in a vacuum. Provide [meaningful and intentional](https://uwaterloo.ca/faculty-association/sites/ca.faculty-association/files/uploads/files/rethinking_the_practice_and_performance_of_indigenous_land_acknowledgement_a.pdf) [territorial acknowledgements](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/territorial-acknowledgements-indigenous-1.4175136). 

* Act as ambassadors of open science, and science in general, to the broader scientific community and the world. Help people see what we do, but respect the constraints others must work under.
