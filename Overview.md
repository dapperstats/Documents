Welcome to [DAPPER Stat](https://www.dapperstats.com)! 

## A brief history

DAPPER, LLC (a.k.a. DAPPER Stats) was formed as an S-Corp in 2015 by Dr. Juniper L. Simonis (they/them) in Portland, Oregon, USA following their post-doctoral fellowship. Dr. Simonis ran DAPPER as a solo consulting outfit for the first few years, but has begun the process of expanding the company in 2019. DAPPER consults for a variety of clients in academic, non-profit, and governmental sectors. 

## Sector and focal work

Dr. Simonis has backgrounds in biological, computational, and mathematical sciences, with a formal degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (from Cornell University) and post-doctoral training in conservation and wildlife ecology. As a result, DAPPER's work has primarily focused on applied natural sciences, with specific emphases in Pacific coast fisheries and renewable power generation.
